# zClans
zClans is a fork of the SimpleClans Bukkit plugin being modified for the use of
the Minecraft Left2Die server at play.minecraftleft2die.com.  zClans is NOT a drop
in replacement for SimpleClans due to changes to the database.  If you know what
you are doing, the SimpleClans database can be altered to be zClans supported,
however there is no automatic conversion.
