# zClans
zClans is a fork of the SimpleClans Bukkit plugin being modified for the use of
the Minecraft Left2Die server at play.minecraftleft2die.tk.  zClans is NOT a drop
in replacement for SimpleClans due to changes to the database.  If you know what
you are doing, the SimpleClans database can be altered to be zClans supported,
however there is no automatic conversion.

## Disclaimer
The cleanup of the original SimpleClans code base effectively puts zClans in an 
alpha development state.  As such, you use this plugin at your own risk until 
it is considered stable.  I still may choose to remove more features from the 
original code base at anytime should I deem them unneccesary for my server.
